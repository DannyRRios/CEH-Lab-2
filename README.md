This is a screenshot of the final step I completed! 

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, I performed host discovery using nmap and then I switched over to windows to use AngryIPScanner to figure out the same information through a different method. I then performed port and service discovery using Megaping and NetScanTools Pro. I then switched to linux and found out the same information using the sx tool. Next, I performed OS discovery using Wireshark and seeing how it related to TTL. I then switched to Linux and used Nmap Script Engine. The tools beforehand were all done without a firewall in place so next I scaned beyond IDS and Firewall using Packet Fragmentation, Source Routing, Source Port Manipulation, IP Address Decoy, IP Address Spoofing, Creating Custom Packets. Finally, I performed network scanning using Metasploit.
